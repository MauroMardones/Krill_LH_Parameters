# Krill_LH_Parameters


Codes and data to calculate krill (_Euphausia superba_) life history (Link, k, t0 and M) in a spatial context in Western Antarctic Peninsula in SO.

This exercise was done to support stock assessment analysis, where this kind of input is a essential component.  

A guid to explain and reproduce this analysis can be found in this [link](https://mauromardones.github.io/Krill_LH_Parameters/)
