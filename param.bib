abstract = {Growth of Antarctic krill Euphausia superbaDana, 1850 is commonly calculated using the Instantaneous Growth Rate (IGR) method based on the difference between the uropod lengths of the moulted exoskeleton and the uropod lengths after moulting. To date, this method has not accounted for sex-dependent differences in body proportion, relying only upon uropod measurements. We measured the carapace, uropod, and total body lengths of gravid females, non-gravid females, males, and juvenile krill from the Indian Sector of the Southern Ocean. Growth rates derived using a combination of the carapace and uropod measurements for gravid females were different from those derived through the traditional uropod-only based IGR, whereas non-gravid females, male, and juvenile growth rates showed no significant difference between methods. The refined method we propose successfully reflects dimorphism in growth between the sexes of krill, with gravid females having enlarged carapaces during the reproductive season. The interaction between growth and reproduction must be considered to improve the reliability of predictions from krill life history models, which is possible through the use of sex-dependent IGR measurements. We propose that, whenever possible, measurements of carapace and total length should be made along with uropod measurements. Together with assessments of maturity stages of krill that did not moult during experiments, these measurements will aid in further informing krill stock assessments.},

abstract = {The South Georgia region supports a large biomass of krill that is subject to high interannual variability. The apparent lack of a locally self-maintaining krill population at South Georgia means that understanding the mechanism underlying these observed population characteristics is essential to successful ecosystem-based management of krill fishery in the region. Krill acoustic-density data from surveys conducted in the early, middle and late period of the summers of 2001 to 2005, together with krill population size structure over the same period from predator diet data, were used with a krill population dynamics model to evaluate potential mechanisms behind the observed changes in krill biomass. Krill abundance was highest during the middle of the summer in 3 years and in the late period in 2 years; in the latter there was evidence that krill recruitment was delayed by several months. A model scenario that included empirically derived estimates of both the magnitude and timing of recruitment in each year showed the greatest correlation with the acoustic series. The results are consistent with a krill population with allochthonous recruitment entering a retained adult population; i.e. oceanic transport of adult krill does not appear to be the major factor determining the dynamics of the adult population. The results highlight the importance of the timing of recruitment, especially where this could introduce a mismatch between the peak of krill abundance and the peak demand from predators, which may exacerbate the effects of changes in krill populations arising from commercial harvesting and/or climate change. {\textcopyright} 2010 Inter-Research.},

One step is the estimation of growth from the progression of LFQ 13 modes through time using the von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF). The option to fit a seasonally-14 oscillating von Bertalanffy growth function (soVBGF) requires a more intensive search due to two 15 additional parameters. This work describes an R-based implementation of the fitting procedure using 16 two new optimization approaches ('simulated annealing' and 'genetic algorithm'). The performance 17 of the genetic algorithm approach in soVBGF parameter estimation was evaluated against a 18 generated LFQ data set with known values. The results indicate that the optimization approach is 19 capable of finding high scoring solutions, yet initial settings regarding the initial restructuring process 20 for LFQ bin scoring (i.e. 'moving average', MA) and the fixing of the infinite length parameter (L∞) 21 both have significant effects on parameter estimation error.

In the past decade, the spatial distribution of the krill fishery has focused on the Bransfield Strait off the Antarctic Peninsula (subarea 48.1). However, the high fishing effort and climate change have placed great pressure on krill resources in this region, and conservation concerns have been raised. Because aging krill is difficult and uncertain, we developed an integrated size-structured model to estimate the fishing mortality, recruitment and spawning biomass of krill. The results indicated that in 1992–2011, the average spawning biomass of krill ranged from 1.14 × 106 to 1.45 × 106 tons, the estimated biomass of the maximum sustainable yield (BMSY) ranged from 3.96 × 105 to 4.90 × 105 tons and the estimated average recruitment ranged from 2.3 × 1012 to 5.03 × 1012 individuals in the research area. We explored the effect of different data weighting schemes for the length data on the assessment output. However, our estimates also have uncertainties. In addition, an attempt was made to analyze the correlation between model-estimated recruitment and mature biomass with climate change. Future stock assessments of krill resources should be comprehensive and multimethod, and the management of krill resources should be based on science that considers the demand of fishing communities and ecosystem protection.},

abstract = {Stock synthesis (SS) is a statistical age-structured population modeling framework that has been applied in a wide variety of fish assessments globally. The framework is highly scalable from data-weak situations where it operates as an age-structured production model, to complex situations where it can flexibly incorporate multiple data sources and account for biological and environmental processes. SS implements compensatory population dynamics through use of a function relating mean recruitment to spawner reproductive output. This function enhances the ability of SS to operate in data-weak situations and enables it to estimate fishery management quantities such as fishing rates that would provide for maximum sustainable yield and to employ these rates in forecasts of potential yield and future stock status. Complex model configurations such as multiple areas and multiple growth morphs are possible, tag-recapture data can be used to aid estimation of movement rates among areas, and most parameters can change over time in response to environmental and ecosystem factors. SS is coded using Auto-Differentiation Model Builder, so inherits its powerful capability to efficiently estimate hundreds of parameters using either maximum likelihood or Bayesian inference. Output processing, principally through a package developed in R, enables rapid model diagnosis. Details of the underlying population dynamics and the statistical framework used within SS are provided. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

abstract = { Antarctic krill Euphausia superba , a keystone species in the Southern Ocean, is highly relevant for studying effects of climate-related shifts on management systems. Krill provides a key link between primary producers and higher trophic levels and supports the largest regional fishery. Any major perturbation in the krill population would have severe ecological and economic ramifications. We review the literature to determine how climate change, in concert with other environmental changes, alters krill habitat, affects spatial distribution/abundance, and impacts fisheries management. Findings recently reported on the effects of climate change on krill distribution and abundance are inconsistent, however, raising questions regarding methods used to detect changes in density and biomass. One recent study reported a sharp decline in krill densities near their northern limit, accompanied by a poleward contraction in distribution in the Southwest Atlantic sector. Another recent study found no evidence of long-term decline in krill density or biomass and reported no evidence of a poleward shift in distribution. Moreover, with predicted decreases in phytoplankton production, vertical foraging migrations to the seabed may become more frequent, also impacting krill production and harvesting. Potentially cumulative impacts of climate change further compound the management challenge faced by CCAMLR, the organization responsible for conservation of Antarctic marine living resources: to detect changes in the abundance, distribution, and reproductive performance of krill and krill-dependent predator stocks and to respond to such change by adjusting its conservation measures. Based on CCAMLR reports and documents, we review the institutional framework, outline how climate change has been addressed within this organization, and examine the prospects for further advances toward ecosystem risk assessment and an adaptive management system. },

abstract = {Poleward range shifts are a global-scale response to warming, but these vary greatly among taxa and are hard to predict for individual species, localized regions or over shorter (years to decadal) timescales. Moving poleward might be easier in the Arctic than in the Southern Ocean, where evidence for range shifts is sparse and contradictory. Here, we compiled a database of larval Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba and, together with an adult database, it showed how their range shift is out of step with the pace of warming. During a 70-year period of rapid warming (1920s–1990s), distribution centres of both larvae and adults in the SW Atlantic sector remained fixed, despite warming by 0.5–1.0°C and losing sea ice. This was followed by a hiatus in surface warming and ice loss, yet during this period the distributions of krill life stages shifted greatly, by {\~{}}1000 km, to the south-west. Understanding the mechanism of such step changes is essential, since they herald system reorganizations that are hard to predict with current modelling approaches. We propose that the abrupt shift was driven by climatic controls acting on localized recruitment hotspots, superimposed on thermal niche conservatism. During the warming hiatus, the Southern Annular Mode index continued to become increasingly positive and, likely through reduced feeding success for larvae, this led to a precipitous decline in recruitment from the main reproduction hotspot along the southern Scotia Arc. This cut replenishment to the northern portion of the krill stock, as evidenced by declining density and swarm frequency. Concomitantly, a new, southern reproduction area developed after the 1990s, reinforcing the range shift despite the lack of surface warming. New spawning hotspots may provide the stepping stones needed for range shifts into polar regions, so planning of climate-ready marine protected areas should include these key areas of future habitat.},

@article{Perreault2021,
abstract = {Stock assessment models often require an external estimate of the natural mortality rate (M) that is usually assumed to be the same for all ages and years in the model. Although the fixed M assumption can be a major oversimplification, model diagnostics (e.g. profile likelihoods) that can help provide an understanding of how the choice of M affects model fit are often not used in practice. In the state-space setting, model diagnostics are especially complicated because of the complex dependencies in the data caused by process errors. To get a better understanding of the effect of broad changes in M across all ages and years on the state-space model fit, we develop new methods that provide profile likelihoods for individual data sources (surveys, landings, age compositions) by decomposing the state-space integrated likelihood. We also use local influence diagnostics to assess the influence of age and year specific changes in M on model fit. We jointly call these methods M diagnostics and apply them to a case study for American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides) on the Grand Bank of Newfoundland. The M diagnostics indicate that most input data sources are fit better with a higher M in recent years. We suggest that M diagnostics should be routinely examined when formulating an assessment model.},

@article{Mannini2020,
abstract = {The natural mortality rate (M) of a fish stock is typically highly influential on the outcome of age-structured stock assessment models, but at the same time extremely difficult to estimate. In data-limited stock assessments, M usually relies on a range of empirically or theoretically derived M estimates, which can vary vastly. This article aims at evaluating the impact of this variability in M using seven Mediterranean stocks as case studies of statistical catch-at-age assessments for information-limited fisheries. The two main bodies carrying out stock assessments in the Mediterranean and Black Seas are European Union's Scientific Technical Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) and Food and Agriculture Organization's General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM). Current advice in terms of fishing mortality levels is based on a single “best” M assumption which is agreed by stock assessment expert working groups, but uncertainty about M is not taken into consideration. Our results demonstrate that not accounting for the uncertainty surrounding M during the assessment process can lead to strong underestimation or overestimation of fishing mortality, potentially biasing the management process. We recommend carrying out relevant sensitivity analyses to improve stock assessment and fisheries management in data-limited areas such as the Mediterranean basin.},
